Allows permissionless public funding of varsity and collegiate athletes in Mexico (and beyond).
A capital provider (sponsor) is rewarded with an NFT representing either 1) an active Superfluid
stream to the athlete or 2) a deposit of USDC/DAI to this contract which is converted to Superfluid
tokens and immediately streamed to the athlete.

Built using Superfluid, Chainlink, and IPFS on Polygon.
