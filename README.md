Athlete Showcase for ethMexico hackathon

In contrast to athletes in the United States, burgeoning young athletes in Mexico do not have public funding offered through schools or their community that can lighten the financial burden and help them focus fully on their athletic career. Our idea is to connect capital providers (sponsors) with athletes and give the option of depositing USDC/DAI directly into the contract which will be streamed using Superfluid to the athlete according to a set rate, or sponsorships can also be streamed directly to the athlete from the sponsor at any rate he/she desires.

The sponsor can provide terms of the sponsorship which could simply be "Must wear our branded logo shirt during X games each season" which would be stored alongside the payment stream on-chain. If the athlete were to not abide by the terms the sponsor could simply cancel the stream and end the sponsorship. The sponsor is rewarded with an NFT Trading Card representing their contribution to the athlete's future. The technology now exists to finally change the future of those that could not follow their dream due to financial hardship. We believe this model could scale to many other categories of athletes including everyone from UFC Fighters to Boxers to Charros to Amateur F1 racers.

Built using Superfluid, Chainlink, and IPFS on Polygon.
